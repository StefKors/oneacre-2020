            <p>The Author starts</p>

          <p>I would like to start with an excerpt which contains three layers &ndash; the historical reference, a reflection and a new addition, the latest commit.</p>

          <p>As a living being, which has begun and will end and then decompose, a human has only one body and cannot (yet) transition to another one, only adjust the one she already owns. Decomposing organisms fertilize the growing ones. Unlike the decomposing machines. Would the world be a better place if we could grow hard drives out of piles of dead floppy disks?</p>

          <p>In his book, &ldquo;Design as Art&rdquo; Bruno Munari describes an orange as the industrial product. After explaining the structure and the content of an orange, he explains the purpose of the seed: "...the sections generally contain a small seed from the same plant that produced the fruit. This is a small free gift offered by the firm to the client in case the latter wishes to start a production of these objects on his own account. We draw your attention to the fact while no economic loss is incurred in this gift, it gives rise to an important psychological bond between producer and consumer...",</p>

          <p>Ironically, one of the most influential tech companies of our time carries a name of a fruit. Imagine Apple giving a seed of an IPhone to its customer?</p>

            <p>How does this relate to the whole text?</p>
          </div>

          <p>I think one of the most interesting things for me was to discover that such definitions as “natural” and “artificial” are incredibly vague. I want to continue with the example of Apples with a capital A and with apples (fruits), both are at the same time artificial and organic. The man-made objects, our devices, are less of object and more of non-human companions, partners and facilitators, thanks to the organic interactions they provide. Apples, on the contrary, offer no interaction, and can be safely eaten and digested. They give me calories, fibre and vitamins to enter the endless productivity loop, where I am the human. I think this text is all about realising own embodiment as both artificial and organic, a human being and a device.</p>

          <p>I would like to read the introduction now.</p>

            Introduction
          </div>

          <p>Sometimes I feel that my body is an obstruction.</p>

          <p>Therefore, I have to state, "I am not my body". The body of work and thought is the true body of mine, not the one which fails to wake up on time every morning. “I am not my physical body” seems to be an absurd statement, but only until there is a possibility to choose from few different modes of existence.</p>

          <p>The level of trust in technology, in a tech saturated environment of the first world, allows to speculate and to suggest that eventually and human brain and machine mind can merge to create a hybrid. The current human body comes with many limitations, so what if we can wire our brains to powerful and tireless computers?</p>

          <p>In that perspective, I do not want to be a human. No, by saying that I don’t mean that I want to stop living, to commit suicide. It is just a reflection on the bitter taste of losing to a machine. A machine, which is so essential to me.</p>

          <p>What are the qualities, in which it exceeds me?</p>

            <p> I am speaking of small-scale computation, mainly about the experience of a creative professional coexisting with her laptop. On a higher level, is the task of computation to deliver results or rather to open up opportunities?</p>
          </div>

          <p>The quality I am craving to obtain is the directness with which the tasks are executed once defined. A machine may crash if the task requires too much of its power, but it won’t have doubts or procrastinate on the way from point A, when the assignment is given, to the point B, when it is delivered.</p>

          <p>As an homage to “The Man-Machine” by Kraftwerk, I‘d call a hypothetical hybrid of me and a computer “The Woman-Machine”, simply because I am a woman.</p>

          <p>Also, because the “robotic chants” make me want to dance. The Woman-Machine is intelligent (which is the quality of a human and a machine), outstandingly productive (more machine, than me) and effortlessly learning (think combination of machine learning and human curiosity). The Woman-Machine never has a writer’s block. And I do.
          </p>

          <p>Besides writer's block, there is a deadline, when this thesis needs to be delivered.</p>

            <p>That particular deadline has passed, only to allow new ones to come, such as preparing a new version of the text. I am still struggling with all the aforementioned.</p>
          </div>

          <p>To add to the complexity to the situation, I have stage fright. Over the last few years I have developed a system of scripting, where I plan the performance or a conversation and also time it with a stopwatch, so I have just the right amount of control. I am writing this answer on a plane, happy to have a seemingly flawless workflow which syncs anything and everything even when offline.</p>

          <p>This is the very moment when I attempt to become a machine: There are vast amounts of software and applications, designed to improve my productivity and I gladly let their interfaces to shape my behaviour.</p>

          <p>Interfaces are designed to guide people through the daily process of interaction with their devices, which often: planning and reminders, online purchases, bills — everything is administered by software. These programs communicate in a natural language (the language, which the human user speaks), enabling the user to learn how to be understood by her device.</p>

          <p>Technology is becoming more and more user-friendly,</p>
          <!-- Commit -->
          <div class="oa_commit">Note from 2018:</div>
          <div class="oa_commit_entry">

            <p>Yet, we are discovering more and more about the hunter-gatherer nature of algorithms ruling our social lives, where the position of a user is not the one of an individual agency but the one of a prey.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Which means that intuitive interaction can create an illusion that the human and the computer are the same, which is, in fact, not true.</p>

            <p>The sentence is very naive itself, yet, I still would not remove it. This statement is totally serious and charged with meaning in any of the fictional universes where humans coexist with embodied machines, such as Westworld or Ex-machina.</p>
          </div>

          <p>In this kind of environment the difference between user experience and interpersonal relationship is not that obvious. The prospect of machines learning faster than humans and becoming super-intelligent raise even more questions about the definition of humanity and the ways humans will communicate.</p>

          <p>Coming back to the “The Woman-Machine”, will sex and gender still exist if there is no need for biological reproduction? Maybe the physical body will have no value in the future? Will there be any hospitals, when organic parts can be replaced with machinery? In this techno-utopian or techno-dystopian scenario, I can imagine no one preventing her physical body from dying. We will be losing our bodies just to be reborn, as a caterpillar dies to start living as a butterfly.</p>

          <p> The illusion of alikeness, facilitated by friendly and intuitive interfaces, makes artificial intelligence somehow expected to become sensitive, and yet to take over humans and dictate their behaviour. The fear of artificial intelligence comes from the assumption or the human expectation that it is similar to a human and has the desire to compete and conquer. But people already coexist with many AI implementations: From simple chatbots, “employed” as sales assistants or leaving spam comments, to complex neural networks.</p>

To train a chatbot manually, the trainer should spend hours on writing the questions and the variations of questions, constructing all the possible pathways for the conversations to follow. Machine trainer is actually one of the professions predicted to grow by the MIT Technology Review: “It takes a lot of hard, grinding work to train AI software to actually be, you know, intelligent. A robotics company might need data on thousands of instances of gripping a part on an assembly line, for example. In December, Google hired 10,000 workers to help clean up content on YouTube and train its machine-learning technology. The jobs created may not be glamorous, or even permanent. But they will be crucial in the transition to a more automated workforce.”</p>

            <p>I failed to get employed after graduating my BA in 2016. I am still unemployed. Currently I work as a freelancer while obtaining a MA in Design from Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam. What I meant in 2016 is that I want to outperform other candidates to score a full time contract. I am aware that becoming a machine is an easy way out of removing socio cultural limitations to my employment, such as the citizenship and gender. But what about the quality of my work? It is absolutely possible to work without weekends, while merging your brain with a computer is still a concept. What I also mean is that as a human I am easily discouraged and could feel upset after receiving a rejection etc. At the moment I am much closer to a mechanised performance – I write applications without having any expectation of the outcome (yet still fully passionate about everything I write about) and am able to continue working on other things immediately after my application gets rejected. I also experience less joy, because I stopped associating an invitation to an interview with a possibility of having a job offer, but that doesn’t matter much</p>

            <p>A few examples of humans performing at the (remote) workplace under different identities or as non-human workforce: Chinese DIY maker Naomi Wu “first came to public prominence on Reddit. She maintains active Reddit and Twitter accounts under the noms de plume of SexyCyborg and RealSexyCyborg, respectively, as an internet personality, her haute couture ethos being decidedly cyberpunk. Professionally she is a web developer, coding in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript under a masculine pseudonym for overseas clients both for safety's sake and to preclude gender discrimination; she also reviews electronics.”</p>

            <p>Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is a platform which provides access to a global, on-demand, 24x7 workforce. Humans are hired to perform image and data procession, collection and verification.</p>

            <p>Also, the algorithms which remove graphic content from social media feeds are in fact people, employed to watch all the disturbing content poured into a world wide web. “Companies like Facebook and Twitter rely on an army of workers employed to soak up the worst of humanity in order to protect the rest of us. And there are legions of them—a vast, invisible pool of human labor.”</p>

            <p>Last, but not least, Fiverr, a marketplace for cheap voiceovers and $5 logo designs, has introduced the character of a doer – exhausted, but optimistic, working anywhere and everywhere, ignoring their physical body to successfully perform in the gig economy. </p>

          <p>Enhanced performance will benefit my position on a job market and make me less insecure about my future. Sometimes physically dying to become a cyber workforce seems less terrifying than failing an interview because of a headache.</p>

          <p>In my experience of tracking various processes in my body with IOS apps I noticed that I have an irrational fear that the application will start evaluating me. For example, my headache tracker app. I installed it to have more accurate information on the amount of migraines I experience in a month, so my doctor can find a treatment which fits the best. I stopped using it after marking one week of daily headaches, because it felt uncomfortable. I had a feeling that after knowing this, the app may start criticizing my lifestyle.</p>

            <p>I think by this time I can handle criticism from an app. What bothers me more is how these apps collect our data and may possibly analyze it and give their conclusions to interested third parties. There is a great irony in producing so many products for mental health and wellbeing in a world where mental health issues are still a stigma.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Some apps are very direct — an app which reminds you to drink enough water will keep buzzing until you give it the number of glasses you drank. Some apps give you the freedom to choose what to track and what to keep to yourself. For example, the period tracker app automatically counts menstrual cycles but also has an additional menu with checkboxes for pills, sex, weight and temperature. There are also separate menus for moods, cramps, etc. Once I told a friend about the mixed feelings I have about using all these checkboxes and he joked that with this kind of interface this app can start a sex-coaching career. We laughed about it and continued talking about our human problems.</p>

Conclusion was meant to finalise the thesis so it could be submitted, graded, evaluated and left by its author – I had to move to the next project, severing the parts. This is not how writing works and this isn’t how I work either. Texts aren’t used to make work. There is a secret/separate life of text, when once written it starts the job, making you who you are, often with resistance. While working for you it enslaves you.
