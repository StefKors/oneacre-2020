            The publication tunes into our highly textured and complex radio
            environment by subjecting itself to the unpredictability,
            seasonality, solar circles of the ionosphere and the current
            location of the reader. The publication embeds itself by using real
            time ionospheric measurements to determine how much of the
            publication and how much of the environment arrives.

          <h2>This is an image bourne on radio</h2>

          <p>
            A radio line-of-sight differs to that of visible light, and so to
            human vision. In the radio spectrum, where frequencies are lower and
            wavelengths larger, a wave will attenuate more slowly, travelling
            further and existing longer. Lower frequency radio clings to the
            Earth’s surface in so-called <i>ground waves</i>, while higher
            frequencies reach over the horizon, reflected and refracted by an
            electrically charged ionosphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            The vocabulary of radio traces the invisible contours of its
            spectral topographies. <i>Rain fade</i>, <i>Earth bulge</i> and
            <i>backscatter</i>. "Go <i>hill topping</i> when transmitting Very
            High Frequencies!"
          </p>

          <h2>Radio</h2>

          <p>
            I use radio to refer to both the device that contains an oscillator,
            modulator, and amplifier, as well as electromagnetic waves in the
            range of 0.2 Hz to 3000 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 100,000
            kilometres to under 1 millimetre. The word might sound antiquated
            but almost without exception all contemporary wireless technologies
            operate in radio spectra. From Earth Observation Satellite feeds
            that negotiate Super High Frequencies, to planetary-scale cellular
            networks, Wi-Fi hotspots, Bluetooth links, television remote
            controls, and microwave ovens.
          </p>

          <p>
            The media theorist Mark Hansen considered radio to be neither
            invention or discovery but a “cosmological revelation” of the
            Earth’s electromagnetic field. Following Hansen, we can imagine
            radio’s spectral presence as a kind of disclosure or cosmic
            utterance. Spectral because we sense its persistence yet it is never
            fully present.<span class="fn">1</span> And an utterance because to
            utter or to articulate means to join together, to form “alliances,
            affinities, and connections”. The argument I want to experiment with
            is that our world is joined, entangled, fully enmeshed with
            radio.<span class="fn">2</span> Indeed, it is becoming-radio.
          </p>

          <p>
            Radio waves blur physis and techne, celestial and terrestrial,
            ancient and contemporary, human and nonhuman.<span class="fn"
              >2</span
            >
            Staying with Hansen, radio possesses a “doublesness” as both human
            technology and cosmic technology. To describe our world-becoming
            radio, is to tell a complex, multiscalar and seemingly paradoxical
            story. A story in which human activity features, yet radio has a
            “dynamic of its own”<span class="fn">4</span> not subject to human
            control.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyone who has transmitted radio, such as an amateur enthusiast like
            myself, knows that the act of transmission is a process of
            negotiation with a myriad of nonhuman actors. From the Earth’s
            curvature and conductive bedrock, to air humidity and the
            ionosphere’s electric composition—anthropogenic transmissions are
            frequently textured by radio of geomagnetic and cosmic origins.
          </p>

          <p>
            At 290 Kelvin, the thermal noise of the Earth commingles with the
            hiss of cosmic background radiation that peaks at 120.1 MHz. This is
            in chorus with the radio hum of celestial bodies, most notably
            Jupiter just below 40 MHz and our sun’s polyphonic bursts.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are the noises we hear during so-called <i>radio silence</i>.
            Hisses, hums and volatile outbursts on so-called empty channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            What do we learn if we tune into radio noise? In other words, tune
            into our highly textured and complex radio environment or milieu.
            Tune into what electronic music composer, Pauline Oliveros, called
            the “negative operant phenomena of the system”, in her description
            of the “whistles and white noise between [radio] stations”.<span
              class="fn"
              >5</span
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Our radio milieu is composed of electromagnetic currents that form a
            wireless infrastructure conducting operations beyond our awareness,
            and on which contemporary life is contingent.<span class="fn"
              >6</span
            >
            Put differently, have developed an attachment to radio and this can
            be theorised as an ontological commitment. Or, to summon Gilles
            Deleuze, an “unnatural coupling”.<span class="fn">7</span> A cosmic
            alliance of multiple and diffuse bodies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our commitment to radio binds us to an electromagnetic milieu that
            is increasingly “dense, codified and politicised.”<span class="fn"
              >8</span
            >
            The idea of a divisible radio spectrum is played out in the
            strata-like bars of frequencies, charts, and regional band plans.
            These almost entirely enclosed radio spectrum, leaving only an
            estimated 2% of useable frequencies open access.<span class="fn"
              >9</span
            >
            The vast majority are licensed, either allocated by governments or
            bought and sold at auctions. This is a politics of radio modulated
            by intergovernmental treaties, corporate monopolies, ionospheric
            conditions, and the radio-active cycles of our Sun.
          </p>

          <h2>Techno</h2>

          <p>
            As discussed, radio can be understood as both cosmic technology and
            human technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            A strategy for understanding how radio as technology acts on our
            world is to ground its spectral presence in a specific material
            history. I propose we return to Hansen and his speech on radio that
            I quoted earlier, which was made at a conference on the Anthropocene
            in 2015. Geologists, atmospheric scientists, philosophers, media
            theorists, architects and artists had gathered at the Haus der
            Kulteren der Welt (HKW) in Berlin to debate the proposition of a new
            geological epoch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those in favour of the Anthropocene argue that the Holocene has
            ended, and we are in a new geological age. Depending on which
            boundary marker subscribed to the nascent epoch began as early as
            the 16th the century when the byproducts of fossil fuel combustion,
            namely inorganic carbon, can be first detected. Or as late as July
            16th 1945 at Alamogordo in New Mexico, when the first nuclear bomb
            was detonated.<span class="fn">10</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Hansen’s provocation at HKW, was to propose radio as a
            “technological trigger” for the Anthropocene. His comments resonated
            with those of Buckminster Fuller, who, over a century earlier, had
            claimed that radio signals do more than stitch the world together:
            they make the world a world for the first time.<span class="fn"
              >11</span
            >
            As Fuller observed, radio does more than connect or image our world,
            it reorganises it.
          </p>

          <p>
            If so, how do we understand radio as having a material history? In
            other words, how do we account for radio waves in a geological epoch
            written in rock? In other words, in <i>deep time</i>.<span
              class="fn"
              >12</span
            >
            Aside from questions of materiality and immateriality, are the
            temporalities of radio and geology not irreconcilably different?
          </p>

          <p>
            First, we must understand the Anthropocene as simultaneously a
            planetary model, project and instrument. It opens a line-of-sight,
            which brings into view specific material histories, and occludes
            others. To the geologists that must ratify new epochs, time is
            rendered visible and divisible by “stratigraphic signals”. That is
            to say, petrified plants, animals and “sedimentary pathways”.<span
              class="fn"
              >13</span
            >
            These are found in “solid aggregate mineral deposits”, in other
            words, rock and fossil.
            <span class="fn">14</span>
          </p>

          <h2>Fossil</h2>

          <p>
            Radio waves draw up antennae, curve parabolic dishes, and coil
            wires. These are <i>technofossils</i>, evidence in the geologists’
            search for chronological markers of the Anthropocene. Radio noise as
            stratigraphic signal.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the tale I am narrating of a world <i>becoming-radio</i>, the
            technofossil renders visible the force of radio in things that are
            not radio. Both directly by accounting for the future geological
            traces of telecommunication infrastructure. As well as indirectly,
            via national constitutions, federal laws, and computer codes that
            shape and are shaped our environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The architect Keller Easterling referred to our radio milieu as
            “C-band urbanism”. C-band is the microwave portion of the radio
            spectrum, initially allocated to satellites. Easterling likened
            electromagnetic radiation, and the first artificial satellites that
            harnessed it, to an “airborne infrastructure”, “dams on a microwave
            sea”.<span class="fn">15</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            In their recent work on the Anthropocene, French historians,
            Christophe Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, conceived the Earth’s
            radio skein as a “second atmosphere”.<span class="fn">16</span>
            Atmosphere implies something to which we have a reflexive encounter
            through the vital and involuntary mechanisms of breathing. Read
            together with reports of climate change it conjures a just fear of
            environmental ensnarement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet neither description fully accounts for radio’s “doubleness” as
            cosmic and human technology. Bonneuil and Fressoz’s atmospheric
            language places emphasis on radio as natural phenomenon. While
            Easterling’s recourse to urbanism stresses its spatial dimension and
            prompts us to think of it as architectural material, I would argue
            the result is an undue emphasis on our radio milieu as manmade.
          </p>

          <p>
            At a seminar last summer, I asked, theorist of political aesthetics
            Esther Leslie to describe in her vocabulary the proliferation of
            radio in the Anthropocene. Her response was simple: “it is an
            intense agitation all around us”.<span class="fn">17</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            I think Leslie’s notion of radio as <i>agitation</i> is compelling
            because it belongs to a family of concepts that are able to move
            between different registers: technoscientific, legal, political and
            social. This is a multiple belonging, appropriate to a technology
            that is both cosmic and human.<span class="fn">18</span> For
            example, political and social definitions of agitate are similar. To
            <i>agitate</i>, is to arouse public interest in a concern, to
            trouble, or be troubled. In technoscientific language it means to
            stir-up, unsettle or disturb. Agitation is also a reference to the
            essence of radio something. Unlike sound waves that are mechanical,
            electromagnetic radio waves do not displace material—they excite it.
            In other words, they <i>agitate</i> it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thursday, 16:34:02 Heated air makes the asphalt dance on half vacant
            parking lots. Sun cuts into the lens. The many lines-of-sight of
            High Frequency Trading radio relays pass through Slough, they split
            and come together in this suburban town best known as the grey
            backdrop of the comedy series The Office. From the roof of the Royal
            Posts’ sorting station, to the neighbouring Holiday Inn Express;
            white teflon wrapped circles. We travel North-East, crossing brick
            row houses, train tracks and hay fields, to the top of a wing in
            Hillingdon Hospital. Continuing along steal and glass in the City of
            London, past medieval ruins in Kent. Lines rejoin at The White
            Cliffs of Dover, again splitting across the English Channel.

          <p>
            Thursday, 16:34:02 The moist from the sea beneath makes the image
            blurred yet we make out the approaching French coastal line.
            Following transmissions to Calais, raggedy white fences topped with
            barbed wire surrounds seemingly unused lots of land. Further East
            the boarder walls run along lorry-filled highways. A fly hits the
            camera lens.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thursday, 16:34:03 Lammersdorf is a small place in Germany about
            half a kilometre from the border of Belgium. It’s categorised as
            that, not a city, or a town, a place: ‘plaats’. Local tourist
            attractions are an agricultural museum, a Catholic Church and a tele
            tower. The large antennas are hovering above the trees of this
            forested region, round and white, clinging to its upper section. Six
            of their flat-stretched rubber faces point in a North-Eastern
            direction, the rest, another five look South-East. From here it
            shouldn’t be more than a couple of jumps and microseconds before the
            final destination; a data centre in the outskirts of Frankfurt.
            There are lazy hums of harvesters working fields nearby, and a
            continuous whizz from the road. A farm house dwarfed by the large
            metal construction.

            In 25 minutes the transmissions passing by the drone, in a 10 mm
            radius, will be cut off. Tomorrow they will continue to fly through
            these German woods, to a data center in the outskirts of Frankfurt,
            back across a hilltop overlooking the old coal factory in Liege,
            then through the French countryside again across the Straight of
            Dover, back and forth endlessly, between 9 and 5.
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s wooden hunting huts with tall legs and overgrown grasslands.
            We pass a small river and are on the way towards an endlessly
            forested horizon when the drone slows down until it comes to a
            complete halt. Its’ signal lost, it pivots, searching for the ground
            receiver. Stopping again, before pivoting another 20 seconds,
            slowing down, orienting. Shifting direction slightly, it picks up
            speed and returns to the tele tower.

        [4] The idea of agency (the power to act) being delimited by the scale
        is taken from an article by the geologist Haff, P. in the Anthropocene
        Review, 2014; 1(2): 126–136, ‘Humans and technology in the
        Anthropocene’: Six rules’ “(1) the rule of inaccessibility, that large
        components of the technosphere cannot directly influence the behavior of
        their human parts; (2) the rule of impotence, that most humans cannot
        significantly influence the behavior of large technological systems; (3)
        the rule of control, that a human cannot control a technological system
        that expresses a larger number of behaviors than he himself; (4) the
        rule of reciprocity, that a human can interact directly only with
        systems his own size […]”
